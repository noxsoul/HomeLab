# HomeLab
Small project to build a homelab server to host VMs and containers for coding development.

## The Hardware
I wanted a budget pc to host just a few virtual machines.  The pc should be able to handle just the basics: a source control system, automated build system and the development server (I.e. LEMP or something similar).  I also wanted to play with containers like Docker too.

### Parts List:
| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 1500X | |
| CPU Heatsink | Noctua NH-L9x65 | Love noctua and like things quiet!!! | |
| Mainboard | Gigabyte GA-B350N-Gaming Wifi | |
| RAM | Ballistix Sport LT 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR4 2400 | |
| Power supply | Seasonic FOCUS FM series 550w (SSR-550FM) | Big fan of seasonic too |
| Video Card | MSI Computer Video Card GT 710 2GD3H LP | Needed dedicated card for just setup |
| Hard drive | WD Blue 3D NAND 250GB | Old hard drive but will work for now |
| Case | BitFenix Mini-ITX Tower Case, Arctic White BFC-PRO-300-WWXKW-RP | |

## The Build
The build went pretty smooth since there really isn't too much to this computer.  I had a couple small items that needed to be addressed and will outline below some of the pictures.
